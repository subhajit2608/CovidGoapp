We are planning to build an application through which victims of Covid-19 can put their data and once an effective data set is built we can train a machine learning model . The parameters of the data set will be
1. How many times he/she went out .


2.Their city , if they visited abroad recently if yes then which country(we will take the ratio of victims to their population density as a parameter ) if no then we will put a zero.

3. The cases in their home town by simply accessing their location ( we will again take the ratio of victims to the population density of that area) .


Once data set is built we can train a regression model to predict the chances of a person being a victim of Covid-19 and once that information is available we can simply observe in which area the no of suspected no of people is greater through which we can tell the chance of an area being affected by this situation.

 "Parameters of the data set is limited now but we are planning to add more so that more accurate models can be built.
